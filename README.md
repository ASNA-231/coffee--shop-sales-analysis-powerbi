This dashboard analyzes sales performance of a coffee shop chain to identify the best-performing product categories, top selling items, store-wise contribution, average pricing and monthly revenue trend. The insights help understand which drinks and bakery items drive higher conversions, how each branch performs in comparison, and which months generate higher seasonal demand. This aids better product planning, inventory alignment, pricing strategy and promotional decisions.
